# Model Predictive Control Project

#### Here I will consider the [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/896/view) points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

## Compilation
### 1. Your code should compile.
_Meets Specifications: Code must compile without errors with cmake and make._

Yes, it does compile on my MacBookAir with MacOS Sierra (10.12.6).

## Implementation
### 1. The Model
_Meets Specifications: Student describes their model in detail. This includes the state, actuators and update equations._

### 2. Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt).
_Meets Specifications: Student discusses the reasoning behind the chosen N (timestep length) and dt (elapsed duration between timesteps) values. Additionally the student details the previous values tried._

### 3. Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing.
_Meets Specifications: A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described._

### 4. Model Predictive Control with Latency.
_Meets Specifications: The student implements Model Predictive Control that handles a 100 millisecond latency. Student provides details on how they deal with latency._

## Simulation

### 1. The vehicle must successfully drive a lap around the track.
_Meets Specifications: No tire may leave the drivable portion of the track surface. The car may not pop up onto ledges or roll over any surfaces that would otherwise be considered unsafe (if humans were in the vehicle)._

Yes, it does successfully drive a lap around the track without leaving the drivable portion of the track surface.
